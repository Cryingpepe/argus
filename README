CSE 363 HW1 - Argus Skeleton

Files
- argus.py: starter implementation skeleton for HTTP/TLS/DNS request sniffing.
- README: this file.

Environment (Kali Linux 2025.4)
- sudo apt update
- sudo apt install -y python3-scapy python3-cryptography tcpdump wireshark

Usage
- Offline trace:
  ./argus.py -r test.pcap

- Live capture (default interface if -i omitted):
  sudo ./argus.py -i eth0

- With BPF expression:
  sudo ./argus.py -i eth0 host 192.168.0.123

Current coverage in this skeleton
- Argument parsing for -i, -r, and optional BPF expression.
- Per-packet parsing hooks for:
  - DNS A requests (+ INTERNAL tld tag)
  - HTTP GET/POST/PUT requests (+ automation User-Agent tag)
  - TLS ClientHello SNI extraction (+ NO SNI fallback)
- Output prefix formatter: timestamp + src/dst IP:port.

Notes
- No IP defragmentation or TCP reassembly is implemented (per HW requirement).
- Protocol detection is packet-content based, not fixed destination port based.
- You should still validate with your own test.pcap and tune edge cases.
